## The Strategy
## WHO IS THIS FOR AND WHY THEY NEED A WEBSITE

This is for anyone who wants to take a break, short time filling distraction that is fun, easy to operate and understand.
The game should be fun but challenging giving the user the opportunity to select how hard or easy they wish the game to be.



## PROJECT AIM 

The aim of the project is to build a website that provides a simple, fun, quick, interactive, challenging game for the user.


## WEBSITE NEEDS (business needs)

- To explain how the game works to the user

- To provide a quick easily repeatable game

- Content to be atarctive and interesting

- The game needs to simple enough that anyone can understand the how it works quickly 

- The game needs different levels of challenges, to cater for everyone and to suit the current mood of the user.


## WEBSITE DESIGN NEEDS

- Website needs to fun and friendly

- simple and quick to navigate

- Simple and easy to use

- Explain how the website works effectively

- website will be built with HTML,CSS and JavaScript

## USER NEEDS 

- How the game works

- How to start the game 

- How to make the game easier or harder depending on ability or mood

- Understand what is going to happen when the game starts

- A certain amount of joy and satisfaction from playing the game




## ACTION PLAN

To achieve the aim of the project I'm going to design a website consisting of 2 pages, a home page and a game page.

### The Home Page

- The Home page will be the main opening page of the site, it will contain an introduction to the game and instructions on how to play, as well as links to the game itself.

### The Game Page 

- The game page will dedicated to the game itself, this will be where the user plays the game

## WEBSITE DESIGN CHOICES

### Website Navigation

- To help visitors move between the pages I'm going to input a navbar. This will sit in the header of main body of the page. 
To keep the website simple and easy to use I'm going to have the same header on both pages of the site. This will help visitors intuitively understand how to move around the website.

- The header will consist of the name of the website/game and navbar.


### Website Main body

- This is the area where the main content as described in the action plan will sit on each page.

### colours 

- I have choosen to use a combination of 6 basic colours for the website, using multi-coloured text to make the page more fun and appealling. The six colours are:

- <span style="color:red" >red</span> 
- <span style="color:green">green</span>
- <span style="color:blue">blue</span>
- <span style="color:gold">gold</span>
- <span style="color:orange" >orange</span> 
- <span style="color:purple">purpler</span>

- Because of my choice to use multi-coloured text, the main page background is going to be left white.

### Font Family 

- The font choosen for the website is Fredoka with cursive backup from google fonts :https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka+One?query=Fredoka+One+

- The font was choosen as it is stylish but still clear and easily readable. To keep the flow and look of the website simple but stylish the same font is used throughout the site.
